        German Shepherds are large, strong, and intelligent dogs known for their loyalty, courage, 
        and work ethic. They are highly trainable and versatile, often used in roles like police 
        and military work, search and rescue, and as service dogs. Physically, they have a distinctive 
        double coat, erect ears, and a long, somewhat bushy tail.
